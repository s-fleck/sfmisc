# sfmisc

Utility functions that I use across many of my packages, but that 
don't warrant an external dependency. All functions in sfmisc depend only on
base R.

sfmisc can be loaded like any normal R package, but it is designed to be 
embedded into other R packages with `sfmisc::use_sfmisc()`.


This package is similar in fashion to 
[freebase](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/freebase) which is aimed at a wider
user base.
